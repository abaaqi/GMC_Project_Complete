## Overview

**MahaFarm** is a full-stack precision-agriculture platform that helps farmers monitor
their fields, automate irrigation, detect crop disease with computer vision, sell produce
directly to buyers, and ask an AI assistant for guidance — all from one dashboard.

This repository is built as a **portfolio project in three phases**. You are currently
looking at the **complete** codebase: Phase 1 (Frontend), Phase 2 (Backend), and Phase 3 (Deployment).

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|------:|-------|:------:|
| **Phase 1** | **Frontend** — React UI components, navigation, interaction, design system | ✅ **Done** |
| **Phase 2** | **Backend** — Express routes, controllers, Mongo models, CRUD, auth & sessions | ✅ **Done** |
| **Phase 3** | **Deployment** — Docker, env config, CI, and cloud hosting | ✅ **Done** |

> **Backend (Phase 2)** lives in [`server/`](./server) with its own README and full API
> docs. **Deployment (Phase 3)** is covered in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) — run the
> whole stack with `docker compose up --build`, or host the frontend and API separately.
> The frontend talks to the API when `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA=false`, and falls back to
> built-in mock data otherwise, so it always runs standalone too.

## ✨ Phase 1 — what's included

A complete, responsive, multi-page React front end with a custom design system.

### Marketing site
- **Landing page** with an animated "living dashboard" hero, feature grid, how-it-works
  loop, impact figures, pricing tiers, and a call-to-action band.

### The app (dashboard shell)
- **Overview** — KPI cards, 24-hour soil-moisture area chart, water-savings bar chart,
  live sensor tiles, alerts feed, automation schedule, and fields needing attention.
- **Crop monitoring** — filterable/searchable field cards with health rings, growth-stage
  and moisture progress, and per-field recommended actions.
- **Disease scan** — drag-and-drop leaf upload with a simulated vision-AI flow that returns
  a diagnosis, confidence, severity, and treatment plan.
- **Weather** — current conditions, a 7-day forecast, and crop-tuned advisories.
- **Marketplace** — produce listings with category filters, live price trends, and an
  in-memory cart.
- **Assistant** — a chat interface with suggestion chips and contextual sample replies.

### Auth & system
- **Login** and **Register** screens with a branded split layout.
- A custom **404** page.

### Design system
- Token-driven CSS (color, type, spacing, radius, shadow) in `src/index.css`.
- Reusable components: stat cards, sensor cards, progress rings/bars, badges, buttons.
- **Signature element:** an animated chartreuse **PulseLine** — the farm's "vital sign."
- Fully responsive, keyboard-focus styles, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

| Soil greens | `#0A1610` → `#244B34` | App surfaces & ink |
| Leaf greens | `#1B5E3F` → `#4DAE7C` | Brand |
| Sprout (signature) | `#C8F24B` | "Live data" / AI accent |
| Harvest amber | `#ECA72C` | Warnings, sun, highlights |
| Paper | `#F6F3EA` | Marketing surfaces |

**Type:** Sora (display) · Inter (body) · JetBrains Mono (data).

## 🧱 Tech stack

- **React 18** with hooks
- **Vite** for fast dev/build
- **React Router 6** for navigation
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **lucide-react** for icons
- **Plain CSS** with custom properties (no UI framework — every pixel is intentional)

---

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the dev server (opens http://localhost:5173)
npm run dev

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

> Requires Node.js 18+.

## 🔭 The three phases

### Phase 1 — Frontend ✅
- React UI, navigation, and an opinionated design system; all screens runnable on mock data.

### Phase 2 — Backend ✅ ([`server/`](./server))
- Express REST API for fields, sensors, alerts, products, tasks, and scans
- Mongoose models mirroring the shapes in `src/data/mockData.js`
- JWT authentication with httpOnly-cookie sessions; aggregate dashboard endpoint
- A seeder that loads the demo farm

### Phase 3 — Deployment ✅ ([`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md))
- Frontend wired to the API: `src/lib/api.js`, an auth context with real sessions, a
  `useResource` data hook, and a protected dashboard route — with a mock fallback so the
  UI still runs with no backend
- Full-stack **Docker Compose** (MongoDB + API + nginx-served frontend, one command)
- Cloud configs: `render.yaml`, `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, and a GitHub Actions CI workflow

---

## 📝 Notes

- Mock data is intentionally shaped like the API payload, so flipping
  `VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_DATA` to `false` switches every screen to live calls with no code change.
- App/cart/chat state is kept **in-memory** (React state) — no browser storage — so the
  client runs anywhere.
- The disease scan and assistant are simulated on the backend in Phase 2; the contracts are
  ready to swap in a real vision model and language model later.
